**Note: Only steering values are predicted keeping speed constant**

 I have collected the data and trained it on FH3(orza horizon 3).In the game difficulty setting,the gear shifting was set to manual(this acts as car speed control).The gear was set to 1 and throttle was set to full through out the process.A Xbox controller is used to control the car and these inputs are recorded for training.
 
## Dataset Collection
 To collect the data run **datasetgenerator.py** and don't forget to change gear shifting mode to manual.And set the screen monitor values as per your requirement.
 While collecting data use:         **'P'** key to pause
                                    **'S'** key to save collected data
